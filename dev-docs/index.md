# Misago Developer Reference

This directory contains reference documents for Misago developers.

> **Note:** This documentation is a temporary solution. In future I aim to generate Misago's dev documentation from it's codebase, and use Docusaurus to both version it and make it more attractive to browse.


## Notifications

Misago's notifications feature is implemented in the `misago.notifications` package.
